Introduction
============

Scribe-utils is the collection of C++ scribe clients (and scribe wrapper) 
which are used to send the messages to the Scribe server.
(Scribe is a server for aggregating log data that's streamed in real
time from clients.See the Scribe Wiki for documentation:
http://wiki.github.com/facebook/scribe)

At present, the collection includes:
- scribe_stdin: The scribe_stdin client listens to standard input for the messages
	which are to be sent to scribe server.
- scribe_tail: The scribe_tail client is a file tailer which listens to a log file 
	and send the messages to the scribe server.
- libscribewrapper: The libscribewrapper is the wrapper which converts the
	plain text messages to the Scribe server understandable format (i.e.
	Thrift RPC calls). It is available as a shared library which can be
	used for creating user derived clients.

Scribe-utils also supports running clients in debug mode which prepends few
special fields with the original messages. These special fields can be used
later to validate the messages integrity.
The debug message is in the format of

mode>>>uid>>>starttime>>>counters>>>senttime>>>orig_msg

where,
mode: can have three values BEGIN, STEP, END.
	BEGIN signifies the start of batch of messages.
	STEP signifies consecutive message
	END signifies the end of batch of messages
uid: Unique id for each batch of messages
starttime: Time when the a batch of messages started sending
counters: incremental counter (+1) for the batch of messages.
senttime: Time when individual message was sent.
orig_msg: Original message.
